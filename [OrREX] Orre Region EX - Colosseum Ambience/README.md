# [OrREX] Orre Region EX - Colosseum Ambience

## What is OrREX?

OrREX (or Orre Region EX) is a mod project aiming to organically integrate Pokémon Colosseum assets into PokeMMO. The focus of this ambition is to make a lightweight and non-intrusive flavouring to the already existing experience the game is seeking to achieve.

No 'unique' regional assets (such as the music for diffeent Teams) will be covered in this project. The only aim is to replace assets that are generic and/or not essential i.Trainer battle encounters, which may as well be generic!

I hope you enjoy these mods.
