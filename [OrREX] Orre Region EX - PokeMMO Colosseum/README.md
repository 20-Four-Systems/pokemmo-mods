# [OrREX] Orre Region EX - PokeMMO Colosseum

## What is OrREX?

OrREX (or Orre Region EX) is a mod project aiming to organically integrate Orre assets into PokeMMO. The focus of this ambition is to make a lightweight and non-intrusive flavouring to the already existing experience the game is seeking to achieve.

I hope you enjoy these mods.
